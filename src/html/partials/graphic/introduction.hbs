	<p>The annual Baseball Hall of Fame election is always fuel for impassioned discussion. It goes beyond statistics to such topics as the use of performance-enhancing drugs and character. In recent years, even the process of selecting players for Cooperstown has come under scrutiny. No other Hall of Fame generates more debate.</p>

The results will be announced on Jan. 18, but in the interest of full disclosure, we present the Globe ballots and each writerâ€™s explanation of their choices.</p>
